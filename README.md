# Travel Slate

Travel Slate is a database application intended to make planning vacations easier. The application allows for users to save travel plans to their library as well as write reviews on plans that they have purchased. Additionally, Travel Slate utilizes SQL to perfom analytics on consumer travel habits as well as create faceted searches to make finding your next plan easier.

To run Travel Slate, you must have a connection to Gonzaga University wifi. Additionally, you will need to have access to my personal database within the cps-database.gonzaga.edu database system. Once you have access to the database, you will need to connect to a locally hosted server to run the PHP pages. In the terminal, enter: php -S localhost:8000. Then in a web browser of your choice, type in the following link: localhost:8000/Login.php.

To get a better understanding of Travel Slate, feel free to view an in-depth demo of it development in the video in my repository. (Watch in 1.25x speed for a shortened version)

I hope you enjoy. Thank you!
